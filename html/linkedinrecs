Bullets only (no paragraphs)
Strong verbs (Implemented... not Assisted; Created... not Learned)
Only Stuff, no Fluff (what you did, not what you'd like to do)
Exhibit confidence in your wording
You must cross-reference any skills mentioned in the place you used them, and how
Your Experience section should include your time at Skill Distillery (as well as a brief mention again within the Education section).
